[PHP]
; --- General Settings ---
; Hides the PHP version in HTTP headers for security.
expose_php = Off

; --- Performance & Resource Limits ---
; Set a reasonable memory limit. 256M or 512M is often enough. Adjust if you have specific memory-intensive tasks.
memory_limit = 512M
; Set a safe execution time for web requests. Long-running tasks should be offloaded to queues.
max_execution_time = 60
; Keep these values aligned with your application's file upload needs.
upload_max_filesize = 128M
post_max_size = 128M

; --- Error Handling (Production) ---
; CRITICAL: Never display errors in production. This exposes sensitive information.
display_errors = Off
; Log all errors to be able to debug issues without exposing them to users.
log_errors = On
; In Docker, it's best practice to log to stderr to be captured by the container's logging driver.
error_log = /dev/stderr
; Report all errors except for deprecation notices and strict standards for cleaner logs.
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT

; --- Session Security ---
; Ensures session cookies are only sent over secure (HTTPS) connections.
session.cookie_secure = On
; Prevents client-side scripts from accessing the session cookie, mitigating XSS attacks.
session.cookie_httponly = On
; Mitigates session fixation attacks by ensuring the server only accepts valid, server-generated session IDs.
session.use_strict_mode = On


[opcache]
; --- OPcache General Settings ---
opcache.enable=1
; Memory for OPcache. 128M or 256M is often sufficient. Monitor usage to find the optimal value.
opcache.memory_consumption=256
; Optimize based on the number of PHP files in your project. A good start is to count them (`find . -type f -name "*.php" | wc -l`) and choose the next highest power of 2.
opcache.max_accelerated_files=10000
; Recommended for production to improve performance by not checking file modification times.
; Remember to restart/reload php-fpm after each deployment to clear the cache.
opcache.validate_timestamps=0
opcache.revalidate_freq=0
; Saves memory by storing identical strings only once.
opcache.interned_strings_buffer=16

; --- OPcache JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation (PHP 8+) ---
; Enables the JIT compiler. 'tracing' offers the best performance.
opcache.jit=tracing
; Amount of memory reserved for JIT compiled code.
opcache.jit_buffer_size=100M
